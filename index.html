    <h1>Why Bears are Best</h1>
      <p>Grizzly bears possess a biting force of over 1200 PSI, which is enough to crush a bowling ball, or an iron skillet.

        Adult grizzly bears can run up to an incredible 40mph, which is the same pace as a greyhound, and would actually break the speed limit on many roads in the US!
        
        Polar bears, the largest of all bear species, can weigh between 900-1500 pounds and grow approximately 6-10 feet long!
        
        With all of these incredible physical traits, it's no wonder that bears have proven themselves to be dominant predators in the wild.

       <p> Bears are one of the most intelligent land animals in North America. They have the largest and most complex brains in comparison to other land mammals their size and they rely on this brain for a number of behaviors. 

        For example, grizzly bears can remember hotspots for food even after ten years and some have even been observed covering their tracks or hiding behind rocks and trees to avoid detection by hunters. Grizzly bears have also learned to camouflage their scent by rolling around in rotting flesh in order to sneak up on prey.
